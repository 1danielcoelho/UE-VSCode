# What is this?

This is a complete set of files you can drag and drop onto your Unreal Engine (Github source) installation which allows a full VSCode-based workflow for editing engine and project source, cooking, packaging, and more.

For more details check out [my blog post](https://1danielcoelho.github.io/unreal-engine-vscode-workflow/) describing how to use this.
